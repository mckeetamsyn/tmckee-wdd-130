      <p>We could create and add new things as we learn and grow. We want to share our work so that others, as they are struggling during this time or are bored, they can find something of interest and follow us as we continue to learn and grow.

        Our goal is to reach those who want to get away from the grasps of just simple technology and to find and learn new things. Families who have a range of interests could benefit from what L.S.T.A.G.S. has to offer. A wide range of interests that would appeal to those who want to escape the digital world but donâ€™t know how. From fathers, boys, mothers and daughters, there is bound to be something of intrigue to whomever comes across this site. Take a look at this site on any device, and then take what you learn and step away from the device.
