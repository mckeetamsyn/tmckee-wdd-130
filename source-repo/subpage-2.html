        <p>L.S.T.A.G.S works to learn and share experiences and material as a middle-aged family with a wide range of experiences. We can form outlets to some of the crazy things that go on in the world and to focus on what will help you find joy. To share our love of the arts, the outdoors, and good olâ€™ fashion family fun. To share love of creation with others and to inspire others to do the same. To document the creative process and learning process for others to see. To focus on getting outside or into the shop. Whatever it is you are looking for, we want to help you find.</p>

        <p>We want to create something 100% dedicated to the enrichment of families beyond the walls and screens. We must always seek learning and share our knowledge and learning process with others. As we learn, experience, and have fun, we must always have others in mind so that we can provide and present each of these things. As we feel the joy and love that comes from the many activities and pieces, we can record and express these things to others so not only are we enjoying ourselves, but we are spreading whatever we learn and feel with others who may need help.</p>
